This project was for partial fulfillment of requirement for AI course

I Created a multi-layer neural network (one hidden layer) for multi-class
classification. And allowed the user to build the neural network and choose the activation function and upload the test files and enter the learning rate, maximum number of epochs, goal and also test the model by entering an out of sample data

I have used html, css, javascript 

her is some pictures from the application
